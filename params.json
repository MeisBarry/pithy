Thus, pithy should be run on a server \r\n\r\n1. that is routinely backed up (like all good servers should be)\r\n2. has nothing that you don't want the world to see that is not encrypted (ditto)\r\n3. that can suffer some downtime if someone does something stupid\r\n\r\nbecause pithy just runs from a directory, standard http authentication can be applied to make stuff safe.\r\n\r\n###pithy requires \r\n\r\n1. a fairly up to date (not 3.0 though) python installation\r\n2. [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)   \r\n3. science stuff! I like to to use [EPD](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php), but scipy, numpy and matplotlib should be sufficient \r\n\r\n###installation/usage\r\n\r\n1. clone repository to where you want stuff\r\n2. cd to that directory\r\n3. run \"node index.js\"\r\n4. navigate to http://localhost:3000  (or wherever you put stuff).  you should see a page, and the URL should have a random string of characters appened.  try some python.\r\n5.  now add whatever name you want to the URL (numbers,letters and (-,_) only.  Run some code here.  Share the url if you're running on an accessisible server.  repeat.  now you're pithy.\r\n","name":"Pithy","google":""}
